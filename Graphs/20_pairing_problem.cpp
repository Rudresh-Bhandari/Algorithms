/*
Q-There are N cities numbered from 0 to N-1. You have to choose 2 cities such that there is no path from first city to second city .
You are given information in the form of M pairs (X,Y) i.e there is an undirected road between city X and city Y.
Find out the number of ways in which cities can be chosen.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers, N and M separated by a single space. M lines follow. Each line contains integers separated by a single space X and Y denoting road between X and Y.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000 1 <= M <= 100000 0 <= X,Y <= N-1

Output Format
An integer that denotes the number of permissible ways to choose a pair of cities.
